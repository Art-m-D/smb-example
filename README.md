Access Samba/Windows-Shares<br/>
===========================<br/>
<br/>
Small example how to upload, download, delete files (use at your own risk). This worked with my mini WIFI-Router USB-Stick-Share.<br/>
<br/>
First you need to download these two python modules: pysmb-1.1.13 and pyasn1-0.1.7<br/>
Then extract \pysmb-1.1.13\python2\smb, \pysmb-1.1.13\python2\nmb and \pyasn1-0.1.7\pyasn1\ to the side-packages directory.<br/>
After adjusting the parameters you might also check the port (139 = default) and other things.<br/>
